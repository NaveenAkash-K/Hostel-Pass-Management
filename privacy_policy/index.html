    <section>
      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>Our app does not directly collect personal information from users. All data provided in the app is manually submitted by users through Google Forms. The collected information includes, but is not limited to, user details such as name, student ID, and other data needed to process hostel pass requests.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How We Use the Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information submitted via Google Forms solely for processing and managing pass requests within the app. The data is used to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Generate and manage pass requests (normal or special).</li>
        <li>Approve or reject passes by Resident Tutors (RTs) or Wardens.</li>
        <li>Facilitate QR code generation for passes.</li>
        <li>Enable security personnel to verify pass status at entry/exit points.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Storage</h2>
      <p>All user data is stored in a secure MongoDB database. We take precautions to ensure the security of user information. Passwords are stored in a hashed format to provide additional security.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>No Sharing of Data</h2>
      <p>We do not share user information with third parties. All data remains within our system and is used strictly for the functionality of the app.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>We use appropriate security measures, including hashed password storage, to protect user data. However, no system is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee complete protection of your information.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>User Data Updates</h2>
      <p>Users are allowed to request updates to their information. If a user wishes to update their data, they can send a request to our designated contact email. Data deletion is not available, as it is essential for hostel management and pass approvals.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>No Tracking or Activity Monitoring</h2>
      <p>We do not track user activity within the app, and no cookies or tracking technologies are used.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>No Collection of Sensitive Information</h2>
      <p>Our app does not collect sensitive information such as financial details or health records.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>No Third-Party Tools</h2>
      <p>We do not use third-party tools, services, or SDKs within the app. All data is processed and managed internally.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
